title: S7 â€“ Service Interface Parameters
legacy: "NAF v3: NSOV-2; MODAF: SOV-2"
---

The S7 Service Interface Parameters View identifies all the parameters used in S3,
Service Interfaces.

## Concerns Addressed

* Detailed Service design.
* Service compatibility analysis.

## Background

Specifying the interfaces that a service provides and uses defines which services are
compatible with which other services. If Service A provides an interface, X, and
Service B requires Interface X, then Service B can call upon at least some of the
functionality of Service A.

## Usage

* Service-oriented architecture governance.
* Detailed service specification.
* Service interoperability.

## Representation

* Tabular.
* UML.

## Detailed View Description

Service interfaces are defined in terms of their operations (methods of access) and
parameters (data that must be passed to the service, or produced by the service).
The interfaces and their operations all have names. Parameters may be simple
types (text, numbers, Boolean) or typed by an entity that is to be specified in a
Physical Schema (P7, Physical Data Model).
