title: What is Architecture?
---

ISO/IEC 42010 describes Architecture as:

> “THE fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution*”.

In the case of the NAF, a *system* is anything that can be considered with a: systemic approach, that is a:

* product,
* service,
* information system
* system of systems, or
* enterprise.

However a description of architecture can be started before any identification
of systems. This is the case when the description starts with a pure operational
description or a set of operational capabilities explaining what the user need
is.

# Why Develop Architecture?

Architectures are developed for a number of purposes. Their development can be
described as both a process and a discipline. Architectures aid the development
of systems that deliver solutions that can meet an organisations needs in
achieving its mission.

Examples of why architecture is required:

* Planning the transition of capability throughout its lifecycle.
* Achieve greater flexibility, adaptability and capacity for cost effective acquisitions and building
  Multinational systems for supporting operations.
* Understanding and mitigating risks.
* Adapt better to changes in the business landscape, industry trends and regulatory environment.
* Align business and technology to the same set of priorities.
* In planning investment and controlling expenditure to business.
* Improve communication within technical domains and between communities of interest.
