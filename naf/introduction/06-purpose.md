title: The purpose and Scope of Architectures and Architecture Frameworks
---

1. An architecture may be used to provide a complete expression of any part of
   the system in an enterprise context. The meta-model defines the essential
   modelling elements that can be used to describe the system in an enterprise
   context and its environment. However care must be taken to have a clear
   purpose in mind for developing any architecture.

2. Architecture Frameworks may define a common language-independent and
   tool-independent formalism for architecture representation, and it provides the
   means to help achieve better communication between architects as well as
   between architects and stakeholders.

3. The use of standardised viewpoints serves as a lingua franca as it provides a
   unified way of describing complex real world objects. It is important both to
   architects and stakeholders that those involved in an architecture process are
   aware of this fact and use it to their common interest. This common language
   will also help to establish a common arena for discussing architectures and
   consequences across communities of interest in NATO as well as across
   Nations and organisations.

4. The NAF supports capturing the vision of enterprise in all its dimensions and
   complexity of system-of-interest. The NAF architectures developed will be an
   important contribution to ensure that the stakeholders of an enterprise are
   focussing on the same goals. Development of operational capabilities and the
   transformational process to reach the objectives of any organisation, for
   illustration in the defence domain the NATO Federated Mission Network
   (FMN) is an example of what NAF architectures will support and in the civil
   domain an example is the European Air Traffic Management project.

5. The role of architecture is to provide an abstraction of the real world. By
   reducing complexity an architecture can be used to support a variety of
   analyses to address the concerns that the stakeholders have in mind. Many of
   the required analyses will be performed in specialist tools, informed by the
   architectures and the analysis results may be used to refine architectures.
   Some of the key types of analyses that can be supported by an architectural
   approach include:

   1. **Static Analyses** – can include capability audit, interoperability analysis
      or functional analysis. These analyses are often ‘paper-based’ using
      simple analysis tools such as database queries and comparisons.

   2. **Dynamic Analyses** – sometimes referred to as executabes.
      these anayses typically examine the temporal, spatial, or other
      performance aspects of a system through dynamic simulations. For
      example, these analyses might be used to assess the latency of time
      sensitive targeting systems or conduct traffic analyses on deployed
      tactical networks under a variety of loading scenarios.

  3. **Experimentation** – where differing degrees of live versus simulated  
      systems can be deployed during experimentation and there is a high
      degree of control over the experiment variables. These can be used for
      a variety of purposes across the acquisition cycle from analysing
      intervention options to validating new capability prior to  For
      example the use of events within NATO such as the Coalition Warrior
      Interoperability Exercise (CWIX) and experiments held at various battle
      labs to provide the ability to conduct human-in-the-loop simulations of
      operational activities can provide venues for experimentation.

   4. **Trials** – medium to large scale exercises involving fully functional
      systems and large numbers of personnel, usually conducted in an
      operational environment as realistic as possible. Such trials are
      inevitably expensive and are usually only utilized for formal system
      acceptance or assessment of operational readiness. (Note: Trials can
      be independently executed or be part of an

# What is the value of an Architecture?

1. Architectures are developed to support strategic planning, transformation, and
   various types of analyses (i.e., gap, impact, risk) and the decisions made during each
   of those processes. Additional uses include identifying capability needs, relating
   needs to systems development and integration, attaining interoperability and
   supportability, and managing investments. The following describes architecture
   usage at two different levels[^value]:

   1. Enterprise level – architectures, particularly federated architectures, are
      used at the enterprise level to make decisions that improve:
      1. human resource utilisation,
      2. deployment of assets,
      3. investments,
      4. identification of the enterprise boundary (external interfaces) and
         assignment of functional responsibility, and
      5. structuring the functional activities in terms of projects.

   2. Project level – architectures are used at the project level to identify
      capability requirements and operational resource needs that meet
      business objectives. Project architectures may then be integrated to
      support decision making at the enterprise level.
  {: type="a"}

2.  Architectures facilitate decision making by conveying the necessary
    information. Setting architectures within the enterprise context ensures complete,
    actionable information for more reliable decisions. The following describes
    architecture data usage for different types of decisions:

    1. Portfolio Management – Identifies objectives and goals to be satisfied
       with regards to owned assets (capabilities and systems) and processes
       to be governed.

    2. Capability and Interoperability Readiness – Assesses capabilities and
       their implementation (systems, platforms, services and aggregated
       solutions) against needs and their net-readiness to identify gaps in
       interoperable features.

    3. Operational Concept Planning – Examines how various mission
       participants, processes, roles, responsibilities, and information need to
       work together, to recognize potential problems that may be
       encountered, and to identify quick fixes that may be available to
       accomplish a mission.

    4. Acquisition Programme Management and System Development –
       Expresses the plan and management activities to acquire and develop
       system concepts, design, and implementation (as they mature over
       time), which enable and support operational requirements and provide
       traceability to those requirements. This process has to be compliant
       with the Enterprise objective and operational requirements. It refines
       operational analysis, performs system analysis, and improves both
       materiel and non-materiel solution analysis.

    5. Modelling and Simulation - Modelling and simulation techniques can be
       used in order to assess the business and mission analysis. For
       example in the military context the implementation of mission threads[^missionthreads]
       and scenarios[^scenario] , thus providing an environment for thorough testing of
       identified use cases.[^usecase]
    {: type="a"}

[^value]: The NATO EA Policy identifies a third level being the Capability level which is between Enterprise
and Project levels.

[^missionthreads]:  Mission Threads have been described as an operational description of end-to-end activities that
accomplish the execution of a mission. No formal definition has been promulgated.

[^scenario]: A postulated sequence or development of events within a particular setting (Oxford Dictionary).

[^usecase]: A use case is a term used in systems and software engineering, it is a list of action or event steps,
typically defining the interactions between role (actor) and a system. I systems engineering they are
described at a higher level than in software engineering and often represent missions or stakeholder
goals.


# Interoperability between Architectures

Architectures must not be produced for the sake of architectures themselves, but as a means to achieve higher level enterprise objectives (i.e. objectives in NATO).

Architecture related processes should be seen as a technique for managing complexity rather than activities to produce models. A common set of architecture processes, such as those specified in NAF, is judged to be the best way of achieving success in the formation of a federation of systems approach.

This concept is not only valid for NATO itself, but also between NATO and Nations, NATO and Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and Nations and NGOs.
