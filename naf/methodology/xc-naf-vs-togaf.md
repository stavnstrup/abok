title: NATO Architecting Method with regard to TOGAF/ADM
---

The NATO architecting method has its roots in the TOGAF-ADM method,
though some major changes have been operated to extend applicability to
any kind of system, tackling thus far more stakeholders and viewpoints
to consider at trade-off analyses.

NAFv-4 architecting method includes stages and dependencies that go
beyond the ADM, to ease the capture and maintenance of viewpoints in
their different aspects along the architecture program, where an
architecture project spans more than one business project. Architecture
is thus applicable to a whole solution life cycle, and can impact other
– interleaving - life cycles.

The main differences in content and objective are captured in the
following table. The focus of comparison is put on key differences:

-   Architecture outcome is an overall solution plan, including
    evolution over system’s life cycle, specifically when the latter is
    interleaved with one or many other (enabling)
    products’/systems’ roadmaps.
-   Architecture motivation data and dashboard at the heart of
    architecting method:
    -   Motivation data strengthen the “requirements” driven
        architecture development method, by documenting and sharing
        architecture scope and objectives upfront “system requirement
        engineering activities”.
    -   For a better understanding of needs from all stakeholders
        perspectives, not only developers, and
-   **Architecture** identify**, evaluate and compare alternatives based
    on motivation data**
    -   According to drivers and stakes, architecture defines the
        top (5-7) criteria to compare alternatives of the
        overall solution.

A comparison is synthesised in the following table.
