title: Guidelines for Architects
---

The following guidelines are to be used in the development of architectures:

-   Architectures should support all planning disciplines. Architecture development must be taken into account during the whole capability life-cycle from concept to operation and maintenance.

-   Architectures should be built with a purpose in mind. The purpose determines how wide the scope should be, what characteristics need to be captured, and what timeframes must be considered. This purpose applies to the development of any portion or view of an architecture.

-   Architectures should facilitate, not impede, communication. The most descriptive and understandable format that is appropriate should be used. On the other hand, architecture experts must be provided with the tools needed in order to ensure a complete, consistent and logically correct architecture.

-   Architectures should be reliable, comparable, and capable of being integrated across organisations. Architectures are to be built in compliance with the NAF Meta-Model (MODEM).

-   Architectures should be modular, reusable, and decomposable. They must provide the specified minimum set of views; use specified standardized supporting products (when needed); use common terms and definitions; and in a standard way, describe multi-national relationships and interoperability requirements.

-   Architectures should be supported by an Architecture Management Plan, to comply with governance directives; and define the scope, timelines and resources to deliver the architecture.
