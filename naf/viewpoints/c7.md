they are applicable.

## Concerns Addressed

terms of MoEs.  These are high-level metrics used to judge the level of
capability.

## Usage

* Setting Capability Requirements.
* Military Estimates.
* Strategic Reviews.
* Planning Assumptions.

## Representation

* Tabular (capabilities on one axis, measure categories on the other).
* UML Classes with property definitions.


## Detailed View Description

C7 presents measure categories that can be used to judge the level of capability. It
traces measure categories to the capabilities for which they are relevant.
