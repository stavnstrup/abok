## Concerns Addressed

NAF v3.1 included the NOV-1 view (High-Level Operational Concept Graphic) which
did not appropriately fit in the Operational View (OV), and was not specifically an
architectural view. NOV-1 views tended to be loose graphical depictions of a
scenario, mission or capability. Recognising that this view was useful, but not
architectural, it is maintained in the NAF but not as part of the grid.

The NAF Architecture Concept Diagram (NACD) provides a graphical view of what
the architecture is addressing and an idea of the players and operations involved. Its
main use is to aid human communication, and it is intended for presentation to high-
level decision makers.

* High-Level Communication of Architecture.
* Senior Stakeholder Engagement.

## Background

The NAF Architecture Concept Diagram provides a graphical, scenario-based,
description of the subject matter of the architecture, showing how the main elements
could fulfil a business or military objective. Any NAF Meta-Model (MODEM)
elements may be shown in the NAF Architecture Concept Diagram, but are usually
represented using a more graphically rich format that one would normally expect to
see in an architecture view.
The Meta-Model provides a graphical fa√ßade
mechanism for presenting architecture elements in the NAF Architecture Concept
Diagram.

## Usage

* Puts an operational situation or scenario into context.
* Provides a tool for discussion and presentation; e.g. aids industry engagement
  in acquisition.
* Provides an overview of more detailed information in published architectures.

## Representation

* Graphic.
* Rich Picture.

## Detailed View Description

The NAF Architecture Concept Diagram provides a graphical executive summary of
the architectural endeavour, which describes the interactions between the subject
architecture and its environment, and between the architecture and external systems.
The purpose of the NAF Architecture Concept Diagram is to provide a quick, high-
level description of the business objective that the architecture is addressing, and
how that objective might be achieved. An NAF Architecture Concept Diagram can be
used to orient and focus detailed discussions. Its main utility is to communicate the
purpose of the architecture to non-technical, high-level decision makers.
