  def: >
    The Architecture Vision is created early on in the project lifecycle and
    provides a high-level, aspirational view of the end architecture
    product. The purpose of the vision is to agree at the outset what the
    desired outcome should be for the architecture, so that architects can
    then focus on the critical areas to validate feasibility. Providing an
    Architecture Vision also supports stakeholder communication by providing
    an executive summary version of the full Architecture Definition.

        Building blocks can be deﬁned at various levels of detail, depending
        on what stage of architecture development has been reached. For
        instance, at an early stage, a building block can simply consist of a
        name or an outline description. Later on, a building block may be
        decomposed into multiple supporting building blocks and may be
        accompanied by a full speciﬁcation. Building blocks can relate to
        ‘‘architectures’’ or ‘‘solutions’’.

- term: Capability
  def: >
    A capability is the ability to achieve a desired effect under specified
    standards and conditions. A capability is realized through combinations
    of ways and means. The ability of one or more resources to deliver a
    specified type of effect or a specified course of action.
  note: >
    The term “capability” has a number of different interpretations
    (especially in the military community). In NAF, the term is reserved for
    the specification of an ability to achieve an outcome. In that sense, it
    is dispositional – i.e. resources may possess a Capability even if they
    have never manifested that capability. The MODEM definition of
    Capability expresses this dispositional aspect from a set-theoretic
    point of view; “A Dispositional Property that is the set of all things
    that are capable of achieving a particular outcome.”
