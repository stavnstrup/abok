title: A5 – Architecture Status
legacy: "NAF v3: NAV-1; MODAF: AV-1"
viewpoint: architecture
---

The A5 Architecture Status View specifies the version number and approval status of
the architecture.

## Concerns Addressed

* Architecture Management & Review.

## Background

Since NAF 3.0, it has been possible to assign version numbers to views and specify
their approval dates. In NAF v4.0, this is integrated with the meta-model’s generic
project & milestone approach so that architecture releases are tracked against the
architecture delivery project.

## Usage

* Architecture project management.
* Release scheduling.

## Representation

The A5 View is based on the meta-model’s generic project structure, but A5
information is usually best summarised in a simple table or text document.

## Detailed View Description

The A5 presents a subset of the NAF 3.1 NAV-1 view. It concentrates on the
versioning and status information of the architecture:

Although the A5 is usually presented as quite a simple text document or table, the
underlying meta-model is much more capable, assigning architecture releases to
project milestones and using succession relationships between versions. A6 and Ar
views reveal more of the underlying meta-model.
