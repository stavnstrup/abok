title: S6 – Service Interactions
legacy: "NAF v3: NSOV-4c; MODAF: SOV-4c"
---

The S6 Service Interactions View specifies how a service interacts with external
agents, and the sequence and dependencies of those interactions.

## Concerns Addressed

* Detailed Service Specifications.
* Outline requirements for Service behaviour.
* Service implementation guidance.

## Background

The S6 View does not specify the sequencing of an orchestrated set of services (see
L6, Logical Sequence). Its purpose is to specify the general sequence of interactions
that are possible for a given service.

## Usage

* Service specification.

## Representation

* UML.

## Detailed View Description

The S6 View specifies how a service interacts with any given agent that has
compatible interfaces. The representation is usually a UML sequence diagram.

Figure 3-22

The view shows a service and the interfaces it exposes; quite often the diagrams can
be cluttered if all interfaces are shown, so it is advisable to consider producing
multiple S6 views for a given service. Each interface in an S6 view has a “lifeline” to
which messages are shown passing. It is also possible to show timing constraints
between messages.
