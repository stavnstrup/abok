# Publication plan

A first step to creating an architecture body of knowledge including
documentation for NAF 4, will be to transform existing documentation in Word to
markdown of HTML. This work can be split into a small number of work packages,
where several of the work packages can be implemented more or less independently of each other.


* Contente of site
  * NAF4 standard
  * Potentially an architecture book of knowledge
    * Best Practices
    * Training materials
    * articles in a blog
    * ...

* Transforming the existing documents from Word to Github flavored markdown - can be done with Pandoc.
   * Organisation of pages
* Deciding of a palette for images
* Recreating the images - preferable using SVG
* Defining layout templates for the site and different document types
* Creating CSS styles (potentially a style guide)
* Defining reusable components
* How to handle binary files such as images, PDF files etc. - a solution could be to use Git LFS
* Social Media: Twitter (properly not), Github, YouTube.
* Google analytics, SEO
