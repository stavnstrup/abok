title: S8 â€“ Service Policy
legacy: NAF v3: NSOV-4a; MODAF: SOV-4a
---

The S8 Service Policy View specifies constraints that apply to implementations of
services.

## Concerns Addressed

* Service Specifications.
* Contracting for Services.
* User / System Requirements.

## Background

To better enable consistency and re-use of service specifications, it is important to
set constraints on how a service should behave. An S8 View specifies constraints
against services to which implementations must conform.

## Usage

* Service design.
* Service governance.

## Representation

* Tabular.
* UML.

## Detailed View Description

An S8 view can present the constraints as adornments to services in a diagram (e.g.
a compartment in a UML class).
