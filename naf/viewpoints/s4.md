The S4 Service Functions View defines the behaviour of a service in terms of the
functions it is expected to perform.

## Concerns Addressed

* Detailed Service Specifications.
* Outline requirements for Service behaviour.
* Service implementation guidance.

## Background

The S4 View is the key behavioural specification for services. Equivalent in nature to
L4, Logical Activities. and P4, Resources Functions, it specifies a set of functions that
a service implementation is expected to perform. Implementation of that behaviour is
represented in P4, Resource Functions, and L4-P4, Activity to Function Mapping

## Usage

* Service specification & planning.
* Governance.

## Representation

* Tabular.
* UML.

## Detailed View Description

An S4 view should be a statement of what a service implementation is to do rather
than how it is to do it. The functions specified in an S4 View should be essential to
the service rather than an attempt to steer a particular implementation approach. An
S4 view is usually presented as a functional diagram with optional flows.
