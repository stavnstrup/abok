The NATO Architecture Framework version 4 (NAF v4) is a standard for
developing architectures.

The purpose of this Chapter 2 is to provide a NAF v4 methodology for
setting up an architecting environment, governing, managing, defining
and evaluating architectures.

Explanation provided by this Chapter can be interpreted as guidance,
rules or recommendation. Level of applicability and tailoring of the NAF
v4 methodology have to be thought by organisation according to the
organisation strategy and business/projects constraints.

Chapter 1 is a general introduction to the NAF v4 and is intended for
those unfamiliar with the framework.

Chapters 3 and 4 give the NAF v4 Formalism with:

* A set of predefined Viewpoints – conventions for the construction,
  interpretation and use of architecture views (Chapter 3).
* A Meta-Model – a standard ontology for capturing the key architectural
  elements and their interdependencies (Chapter 4).
