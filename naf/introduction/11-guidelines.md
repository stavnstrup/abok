title: Guidelines for Architects
---

The following guidelines are to be used in the development of architectures:

* Architectures should support decision-making and planning where
  appropriate.

* Architecture development must be taken into account during the whole
  capability life-cycle from concept to operation and disposal.

* Architectures should be built with a purpose in mind. The purpose
  determines how wide the scope should be, what characteristics need to
  be captured, and what timeframes must be considered. This purpose
  applies to the development of any portion or view of an architecture.

* Architectures should facilitate, not impede, communication. The most
  descriptive and understandable format that is essential should be used
  for communication. On the other hand, architecture experts must be
  provided with the tools needed in order to ensure a complete,
  consistent and logically correct architecture.

* Architectures should be reliable, comparable, and capable of being
  integrated across organisations. Architectures should be built in
  accordance with the NAF Meta-Model.

* Architectures should be modular, reusable, and decomposable. They
  must provide the specified minimum set of views; use specified
  standardized supporting products (when needed); use common terms
  and definitions; and in a standard way, and interoperability
  requirements.

* Architectures should be supported by an Architecture Management
  Plan, to comply with governance directives; and define the scope,
  timelines and resources to deliver the architecture.
