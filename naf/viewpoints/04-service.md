title: Service Specifications Layer
---

The Service Specifications layer describes Services independently of how they are
implemented or used. The purpose of these views is to establish a library of
standard services that support building architectures based on the concept of a
service-oriented architecture. The Service Specifications layer is a description of
services needed to directly support the operational domain.

A service is understood in its broadest sense as a unit of work through which a
provider provides a useful result to a consumer.

The Service Specifications layer focuses **strictly** on identifying and describing
services and does not specify their physical implementation (see Physical Resource
Specifications layer). The Service Specifications layer also supports the description
of service taxonomies, interfaces, policy and behaviour.
