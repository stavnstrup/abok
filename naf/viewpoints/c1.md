title: C1 - Capability Taxonomy
----

The C1 Viewpoint presents capabilities and the hierarchical relationships
between them.

## (NAF v3: NCV-2; MODAF: StV-2)

## Concerns Addressed

* Capability Planning.
* Capability Management.

## Background


The C1 Viewpoint specifies all the capabilities that are referenced throughout
one or more architectures - i.e. one C1 may provide the definitive list of
capabilities for a number of logical and resource architectures.

The capabilities may be organised into specialisation hierarchies (taxonomies).
Measures of Effectiveness (MoE) may be specified for each capability.  Note that
MoEs are inherited down a capability taxonomy.

## Usage

* Identification of existing and required capabilities.
* Source for the derivation of cohesive sets of Key User Requirements (KURs).
* Providing reference capabilities for multiple architectures.

## Representation


* Tabulation.
* Hierarchical (Connected Shapes).
* UML Class Diagram (with generalisation relationships and property definitions).
