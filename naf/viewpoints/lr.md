The Lr Lines of Development View specifies the logical threads (lines of
development) for a set of projects and programmes. The status of each of these
threads can be shown at the various milestones in the projects or programmes.


## Concerns Addressed

* Acquisition Planning.
* Portfolio / Programme Management.
* Project Performance Reporting / Dashboarding.

## Background

The Lr View is primarily intended to support the acquisition process across multiple
projects or programmes, highlighting dependencies the logical dependencies
between capabilities, projects and the integration of all lines of development to
achieve a successfully integrated military capability. Use of the Lr View should
support the management of capability delivery and be aligned with Cr, Capability
Roadmap.

## Usage

* Project management and control (including delivery timescales).
* Project dependencies and the identification of associated risk.
* Portfolio management.
* Through Life Management Planning.

## Representation

* Timeline View.
* Augmented Gantt Chart.

## Detailed View Description

The Lr View provides an overview of a set of individual projects (e.g. within a given
programme or portfolio), based on a timeline. Projects may be broken into threads
(work streams) to show the dependencies at a lower level. Where appropriate, the Lr
View may also summarise the level of maturity achieved across the threads at given
milestones in each project.

The information provided by an Lr view can be used to determine the impact of either
planned or unplanned programmatic changes, highlight opportunities for optimisation
across the delivery programme, and identify potential delays which impact on the
delivery of capability. Action to address areas of concern identified in one or more
threads, (e.g. a shortfall in training resource) can be coordinated across a
programme or group of projects. In particular, the knowledge of the dependencies
between project milestones can quickly inform a programme manager when a
slippage in one project is likely to cause delays in other projects.

In support of the management of a programme of projects, it is desirable to have a
set of common milestones at the programme level against which the maturity of each
of the constituent projects is judged.

An Lr view is presented as a Gantt chart, optionally augmented with project thread
status indicator symbols that indicate the status of each thread at given milestones
and the dependencies between them. This is usually achieved using colour-coding
so that stakeholders can tell, at a glance, the status of a given project at different
points in time.
