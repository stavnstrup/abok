# Purpose

The NATO Architecture Framework (NAF) is a standard for developing architectures.

The purpose of architecture is to capture the dependencies that exist in systems and to aid with decision support.

This chapter is a general introduction to the NAF and is intended for those unfamiliar with the framework. The NAF provides a standard way to model the architecture, by defining:


1. A Methodology – how to develop architectures and run an architecture project
   (Chapter 2 to be issued).
2. A set of Viewpoints – conventions for the construction, interpretation and
   use of architecture views for communicating the enterprise architecture to
   different stakeholders (Chapter 3).
3. A Meta-Model – a standard ontology for capturing the key architectural
   elements and their  interdependencies (Chapter 4).

# Aim

The aim of the NATO Architecture Framework Version 4 is to provide a standard for developing and describing architectures for both military and business use.

# Objectives

The objectives of the framework are:

1. To provide a way to organize and present architectures to stakeholders.
2. To specify the guidance, rules, and product descriptions for developing and presenting architecture information.
3. To ensure a common approach for understanding, comparing, and integrating architectures.
4. To act as a key enabler for acquiring and fielding cost-effective and interoperable capabilities.
5. Alignment with international standards (International Standards Organization (ISO), Institute of Electrical and
  Electronic Engineers (IEEE), The Open Group, Object Management Group (OMG), etc)

# Scope of NAF Documentation

This document provides an overview of the architecture concepts, the structure
and the framework, and indicates where to find more specific information. It
also describes, in general terms, the typical content and format of NAF
Viewpoints, and the relationship with the NAF Meta-Model (known as MODAF
Ontological Data Exchange Mechanism (MODEM)). This baseline replaces Version
3.[1]

# Reason for Change

Both NAF Versions 3.0 and 3.1, and MODAF Version 1.2.004 were capable of
supporting alliance interoperability through coherent use of architectures, and
provided for the re-use of architecture artefacts and products that make it
easier to identify NATO systems and applications.

However neither was applied consistently and had not been developed as a
standard. In addition they did not provide a common approach – by adopting a
core methodology based on utilizing best practice (e.g. The Open Group
Architecture Framework (TOGAF)).

They were also becoming more challenging to maintain because of limited technical resources.

To provide alignment with major terms and concepts with the following international standards:

* ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 Systems and Software Engineering – Architecture Description
* ISO/IEC CD 42020 Systems and Software Engineering – Architecture Processes
* ISO/IEC 42030 Systems and Software Engineering – Architecture Evaluation
* The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) Version 9.1
* ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 Systems and Software Engineering – System Lifecycle Processes
* ISO 15704:2000 Industrial automation systems – Requirements for enterprise-reference architectures and methodologies

Developing NAF 4 enabled the limitations above to be addressed and is a step
towards a Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) as illustrated below.
