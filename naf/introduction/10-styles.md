title:  Styles of Architecting**[10]
---

It is widely recognised that the development of an architecture approach is not straightforward and typically the development of an approach is limited by the expertise and experience of an individual architect. This results in varying degrees of success and a continual need to reinvent. To help architects and the problem owners who commission the use, and ultimately control, the funding for architecture outputs, a small number of standardised architecting styles have been proposed. These styles help to understand the approach that should be taken; set expectations on what can be achieved; clarify what is involved (e.g. in terms of costs, skills and governance); and, help to understand how value is delivered to the enterprise. The styles are driven by the purpose or reason for the architecture and reflect currently observed best practice.

Four styles of architecting have been identified by architecture practitioners (Reference STO-MP-SCI-254-11 UK MOD’s ‘Perfect Storm’ – and the Need for Architectural Styles). They are as follows:

1.  Authoritative

2.  Directive

3.  Coordinative

4.  Supportive
