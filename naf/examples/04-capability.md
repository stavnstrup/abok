title: Development of the Capability Level Architecture at national level
---

This part describes the lifecycle followed by the Yellow country for
developing the Search and Rescue solution in a national perspective at
capability level. This includes the production of the national
capability architecture and the integration of transition architectures,
grouping implementation projects provided by contractors or by the
Yellow Acquisition community of interest[^3]. The implementation project
consists in:

-   A Project architecture detailing the implementation of the system.

-   Information related to contracts, costs and implementation.

-   Complementary information on the realization of the project.

The lifecycle is built using the different stages depicted in :

-   **Prepare the capability:**

    To identify organisations, processes and documents needed for
    establishing the architecture capability. It is accomplished by
    stage: **Establish the architecture Landscape** (AL).

-   **Adjust architecture motivation data**

    To align architecture activities with objectives, and remain
    consistent with requirements, standards and any key
    motivation’s elements. It is accomplished by step **(stage: Manage
    architecture motivation data and dashboard** (MD).

-   **Describe the architecture;**

    To conduct the definition of the RA, including the development of
    alternatives of architectures and producing the architecture
    products needed, it is accomplished at three stages: establish
    architecture vision) (AV), **describe alternatives of
    architectures** (AD) and **evaluate architecture alternatives and
    propose trade-off** (AE).

-   **Integrate implementation projects;**

    To provide a coherent implementation and migration plan including
    the capability architecture and the implementation projects
    (including existing elements, subcontractor’s deliveries or
    subsystems descriptions). It is accomplished at stage **Plan
    migration** (MP).

-   **Govern the implementation and manage changes;**

    To ensure the project remains implemented and executed according to
    the initial mandate, to adjust when change is needed (if the
    operational or the technological environment changes for instance).
    It is accomplished at stages **govern application of
    architecture** (AG) and **decide on architecture change** (AC).

Figure : Steps of the Method for Architecture Development

The following sections provide a detailed description of the phases to
consider for the development of the Capability Level Architecture
(RA).

# Establish Architecture Landscape

This initial and preliminary phase of the NATO architecture
development method ensures that an architecture capability exists in
the organisation for producing the architecture. The architecture team
will be set-up, a lead architect appointed and the information to be
used earmarked.The elements provided during this phase are captured in
an architecture management plan, which will be updated at each step of
the development.

The architect captures each element available in order to describe the
concepts supporting the architecture. To address the capability
architecture of the Yellow country on Maritime Surveillance, the main
questions to answer are:

1.  What is the definition of Search and rescue? What are the related
    concepts? What are the authoritative documents to be used for
    doctrine, capabilities, operational functions and other aspects of
    this domain?

2.  What are the (Internal/External) stakeholders to consider?

3.  What is the objective of the architecture effort? Is there any
    existing work to re-use? Is there any legacy system to integrate?

4.  What are the limits of search and rescue with the maritime
    surveillance domain? What are the relationships to maintain with the
    other domains? What is the overarching scope to consider?

5.  What are the constraints related to time, costs, resources …etc.?

The Famous 6 questions of DODAF could be used during this step for
guiding the questions and the investigations for documentation.

Figure : Aspects to address for architecture development[^4]

The following elements provide the key points to address during the
“Establish Project Architecture Landscape” step and in the
architecture management plan, they are summarized in the table at the
end of the paragraph:

**Prerequisite**

The documents related to the context, drivers and constraints of
architecture capability are available (at least a list of references
and reference points has been identified).

**Steps**

-   From the Enterprise architecture the architect identifies the points
    relating to the architecture capability and the documents containing
    the appropriate information:

    -   Architecture scope (Yellow Country) and Yellow national
        expectations,

    -   Elements existing at Rainbow level related to the execution of
        the maritime surveillance and search and rescue,

    -   Existing concepts for search and rescue, references to doctrine,
        description of the operational functions and activities;
        exchanges of information,

    -   Business strategy, system/product/product-line strategy,
        Product/project portfolios,

    -   Reference to the business strategy. Links with the strategic
        frameworks used in other areas of the organization,

    -   Capabilities lists referred in the Enterprise architecture on
        interoperability within the Rainbow organization,

    -   Elements to be provided:

        -   Capabilities: Links to the Catalogue of capabilities,
            definition of capabilities,

        -   Legacies (capabilities and systems): Timeframe of the
            legacies, time frame of the “to be” architecture, List of
            existing systems with date of obsolescence. The portfolios
            are used as inputs for providing this information
            (technological and products for existing projects).

        -   Budget: Elements of budget to be considered for the
            development of the reference architecture,

-   From the system and capabilities available, the architects build the
    list of existing elements, systems, capabilities and the portfolio
    of existing rules directing them. The architect identifies potential
    projects which relate to the architecture effort. He identifies the
    possible partnerships for developing the architecture and some
    contracts agreements (tools and subcontractors).

<!-- -->

-   The capability architecture is included in maritime surveillance. It
    focuses on SAR. The architecture is indented to direct the
    definition of standards and the national regulations.

-   The architect checks if the documents on acquisition, costs
    analysis, technology assessment exists.

-   The architects confirms he owns elements on :

    -   identification of the objectives,

    -   definition of the architecture method and tools to be used, in
        particular those enabling the identification and comparison of
        architecture alternatives

-   The architect proposes an OBS, a WBS and the related costs.

-   The architect defines the criteria for selecting the views based on
    a set of architecture principles.

    -   The aim of this phase is to select the grid rows and columns
        relevant for meeting the architecture management plan objectives
        related to architecture products

    -   Stakeholders define the criteria for assessing alternatives:

        -   Operational effectiveness,

        -   System performances,

        -   Compliance to standards,

        -   Global cost of ownership.

-   The architect defines the content of the architecture
    management plan.

-   The architect checks that a repository is set up for storing
    architecture products and the reference elements. He defines the
    rules for accessing and managing architecture products and
    additional information to documenting the architecture products.

-   The architect gets stakeholders agreements on :

    -   The proposed architecture method and stages

    -   The proposed architecture tools,

    -   The rules to establish the appropriate links with other
        disciplines useful for the definition of the system (system
        engineering, requirements engineering)

    -   Inputs, methods, tools and references of the Rainbow community

    -   The architecture management plan.

**Outputs**

The main outputs consist in the view **A5**[^5] of the NAFv4 **grid**
(this view corresponds to the NAV-1 in NAFv3) **with an outline of the
architecture management plan**[^6]. A statement of work can also
be produced if any specific need is identified. A modelling
management plan can be produced to prepare the necessary project
architecture tools.

The structure of the architecture summary information-1 is highlighted
hereunder: An illustration of an architecture management plan is
provided in Appendix1, it uses[^7] the following outline:

-   Architecture Development overview

    -   Project Overview

    -   Architecture development goals and objectives

    -   **Architecture development scope**

    -   **Architecture Interactions with other disciplines**

        -   Customer Procurement

        -   Customers’ Capability Management

        -   Local System Engineering[^8]

    -   **Architecture Development key stakeholders**

        -   **Organization of architecture team**

        -   **Approval Authority**

-   Architecture Development Commitment

    -   **Scope of architecture delivery**

    -   **Schedule of architecture delivery**

    -   **Budget of architecture delivery**

    -   **Resources involved in architecture delivery**

The architecture management plan must highlight the following aspects:

-   The Architecture capability is defined in terms of organization,
    process, resources, tools and principles.

-   The Process of architecting is defined, including methodology
    tailoring and selection architecture frameworks.

-   Architecture charter (or architecture mandate).

-   Methodology, Framework, References (Operational, System,
    Technologies, Services, Capabilities), possible tailoring.

-   Resources: define skills and roles in architecting process (roles,
    job descriptions).

-   Project schedule, identifying the main phases of the development?

-   Policies for the definition, selection, preparation and adjustment
    of supporting tools (documentation, configuration management).

-   Principles: general rules and guidelines related to objective and
    drivers, selected from enterprise and/or architecture domains.

The following diagram describes the views of the grid to be considered
for this stage.

# Establish Architecture Vision

Based on the information provided by the “Establish architecture
landscape” stage, or according to the existing architecture
capability, the architect builds the elements of architecture
supporting the goals and objectives as defined in the outline of the
Architecture Management Plan. The outputs consist in the development
of the Architecture Management Plan and of the main drivers of the
architecture. These elements are presented in a communication plan to
the stakeholders in order to ensure buy-in and support before
conducting the main effort of architecture development.

The development of the architecture management plan will include the
answers to the following questions:

-   What must be done?

-   Who does what in this effort?

-   Where is the work executed?

-   When the work is executed (schedule)?

-   How the job is executed (WBS, OBS, Structure, Management)?

-   Why is this job executed?

The elements related to decisions, authority, results and acceptance
of the architecture are included in the high level descriptions of the
system which will be in the capability architecture.

To establish architecture vision, the architect extracts drivers from
goals and objectives of the CONOPS for Maritime Surveillance of the
Yellow country. This CONOPS can be identified in the **Enterprise
architecture (Overarching Architecture)**[^9]. The main drivers
are:

-   Increase the effectiveness of maritime surveillance.

-   Enforce standards rules and implementation.

-   Conduct Monitoring surveillance and information sharing.

-   Address environmental aspects.

The following options can be selected for supporting the architecture
development:

-   Improve the coordination and maximize re-use (of systems,
    information or processes) between the nations,

-   Synchronize the milestones for “delivery time” at capability and
    enterprise levels,

-   Reduce the costs of operation and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

A draft of the operational part of the vision focusing on operational
functions, actors and domains is added. Operational drivers are defined
as follow:

-   Increase the effectiveness of maritime surveillance, by:

    -   Building a safe zone including the Yellow TW[^10] and the
        Rainbow TW (integration of Yellow information).

    -   Operating in the safe zone with the limitations of Yellow
        regulations (for vessels of other countries operating under
        Raibow flag), in liaison with the civilian actors and the
        security actors.

-   Baseline for interoperability:

    -   Maximizing the use of AIS,

    -   Interoperability with air traffic (for SAR),

    -   Interoperability with the emergency actors (Medical) and other
        agencies (environment, human, security).

The architect builds a consolidated report and a communication package
describing the vision to be presented to the sponsor and the decision
makers in order to obtain the approval on the organization on the scope
of work, the work share and the deliverables.

**Prerequisite**

The Architecture board is nominated (officially) and has agreed on the
preliminary framework within available Budget.

**Steps**

-   **Confirm /Update situation, context and constraints.**

    -   The architect checks the objectives of the architecture
        contract,

    -   The architect confirms the list of stakeholders and the
        information they can provide. He builds a stakeholder management
        matrix on the stakeholders’ concerns as part of the
        stakeholders’ management,

    -   The architect identifies and provides answers if the change,
        subject of the architecture development, implies the
        redefinition of the system (change of manning, change of
        resources, new areas or interoperability challenges to consider)

    -   The architect confirms the tailoring of the views, of the
        architecture products and of the process for architecting.

<!-- -->

-   **Identify the main architecture options and critical issues (time/
    availability, quantity, quality, life cycle costs, risks)**

    -   The architect defines the timelines for delivering the
        architecture products,

    -   He identifies the work streams to execute for delivering the
        portfolio,

        -   What are the subjects to address?

        -   What is the level of granularity of each subject?

        -   Which views will be used?

        -   What is the information to be used for developing each
            architecture product?

        -   What are the drivers for change to be used for developing
            the new part of the architecture (What change drives the “to
            be” architecture?)?

        -   What is the best way for integrating the requirement for
            Rainbow interoperability rules?

        -   Process for architecting: the architect tailors the NATO ADM
            for building the appropriate sequence for the development of
            architecture; he clarifies the rules for inputs outputs of
            architecture products (what is to be produced? How? What are
            the dependencies between the views?).

-   **Define the stages and views necessary to scope and map capability
    needs to AoA products.**

    -   The architect identifies the different steps of the development,
        the portfolio to be produced at each stage of the method and the
        mapping with existing references (capabilities, operational
        functions, organizations; services; legacies and pre-existing
        building blocks.

    -   The architect selects the portfolio of views based on the
        stakeholders concerns by using the grid.

**Outputs**

During this phase the following documents are produced:

1.  An architecture definition document or ideally an architecture
    management plan approved by the sponsor.

2.  A first iteration of the A5 (NAV-1) establishing the foundation and
    the target for the architecture development.

3.  A synthetic narrative description of the vision included in a
    communication plan.

The architect develops an architecture management plan and the first
high level elements of the architecture. The documents include at
minimum the following elements

-   A high-level description of the scope for the architecture, using
    capability goals and principles

-   A high level description (or views…) of the capability context
    ((business, industrial, political, operational, legal),

-   Documents to be officially approved and accepted by the sponsor or
    by the customer,

-   High level description of project level strategic objectives and
    goals as understood by the architecture team; and taking into
    account the viewpoints of key stakeholders.

-   Approach considered for architecture development

-   The answers to the stakeholders’ concerns

-   A communication plan including the approval of the architecture
    management plan.

The following diagram describes the views of the grid to be considered
for this stage.

# Describe Alternatives of Architectures

Performing architecture description is the more concrete and output
related activity in the development of the architecture. This stage
embraces the production of the views, documents and their links to the
references in order to describe the capability expected, its structure
and links in its environment. The description is fully aligned with
the vision detailed in the architecture management plan. The architect
focuses on the identification of architectures and on the different
options of the realisation.

The alternatives of architectures (AOA) consist in a limited
architecture work answering a typical concern and securing the aspects
related to them. The AOA evaluation report provided aims at supporting
decisions for engaging the new baselines of Architecture based on AOA
selected by the stakeholders. AoA is a key element in risk mitigation
at project or capability levels.

At the end of the phase, the architecture portfolio is issued,
including all views developed and an architecture report (or an
architecture definition document) and circulated in order to achieve
the consensus on the description of the capability.

**Pre-requisites**

The following pre-requisites are met for engaging this phase.

-   The vision has been published, the review of the sponsor provide
    sufficient guidance and resources for ensuring the development of
    the architecture will be conducted successfully.

-   The architecture management plan is agreed and the work breakdown
    structure is funded

-   The Architecture framework and principles are set and accessible
    to stakeholders.

-   The Tailoring, rules, processes for architecting are clear
    and agreed.

-   All the catalogues and taxonomies available are shared and used for
    supporting the development (NTL[^11], UJTL[^12]; Capability
    lists[^13])

-   An architecture baseline is accessible to stakeholders (in a
    repository consolidating artefacts and describing the
    appropriate references)

-   All the documents needed for developing the architecture are grouped
    and available for the architecture team including documents and
    models on the legacies

-   The method and principles for developing the architecture are
    produced and shared. The architect has a list of views to be
    developed for each domain (communication, IT, information, and
    operational activities) and level of the architecture considered
    (capability, project, and implementation). If the model is developed
    with a tool, the method and mechanisms for producing the
    documentation are in place. The templates and the information to be
    included in the documents are available and tested.

**Activities**

The architect based on the documents available will develop the views
in order to describe the different perspectives of the system
considered. He will start by aligning the design of the solution to a
top down approach based on capabilities and operational views
definition. He will identify the options or alternatives to the top
down and document them in specific views. A sensible approach can
consist in listing the capabilities and operational activities
supported by the system. Having a layer or a tree representation of
the capabilities or activities can be very convenient the “candy
chart” developed for describing the capabilities provides a useful
template of the capabilities.

Usually using a blocks and liaison models enables the description of
the following subjects:

-   Nodes and need lines

-   Systems elements and interfaces,

-   Services and messages

The following cycle can be considered for developing the architecture

1.  Confirm/ update architecture drivers (qualitative assessment)

2.  Confirm/ update list of artefacts (views, rationale, etc.)

3.  Develop architecture views including mapping views to resources, and
    backward links to “evolution needs”.

4.  Update principles list , define the rules and provide the views:
    Describe the different types of views (Matrix, diagrams; UML use
    cases, state machine).

The architecture team produces the views according to the specific
perspectives and viewpoints selected in the grid. The team limits the
develop effort to the “good enough” solution in order to avoid
over-specifications. A Stop criterion can be “did you answer all
specific questions raised by the vision “.

The architect must remember that some tools have a tendency to drive the
architecture development in too much level of details[^14]. Hence the
limitation in the description and a permanent verification of the scope
of the architecture are key concerns of the architect.

**Key point1:**

NAF refers regularly to the “views”. A view is not necessary a diagram
nor a graphical and imprecise description. Views can be produced by the
following artefacts:

1.  Tables, lists

2.  Narratives

3.  Diagrams

4.  Matrices,

The architect decomposes the subject of architecture efforts in main
elements according to specific perspectives or concerns. The
identification of the following aspects is key for producing a reliable
architecture:

1.  The objects to be described

2.  The domains

3.  The relations between objects at the same levels,

4.  The information exchanged

**Key point 2:**

Each object of the architecture must be correctly and completely
documented with an explicit and unambiguous information and reference
document.

Even if a model is used for documenting and producing the architecture,
the architect gives great care to the nature[^15] of the reports to be
generated; in fact these documents constitute the basic reference for
the evaluation of the model.

**Outputs**

During this phase the architect team provides the following documents
and artefacts.

1.  An updated version of the architecture model with the appropriate
    views, the artefacts must match the alternatives that have
    been identified.

2.  A list of alternatives with the views considered.

3.  The documents for supporting the realization of the system and
    its delivery.

The views provide answers to the questions (raised by the vision) and
describe alternatives and options to be assessed later. Options
translate strategic, operational, technical, service and/or programmatic
options. The following elements could be provided in line with the
Architecture Management Plan:

-   A Draft architecture report capturing the portfolio as tailored in
    the vision and earlier phases.

-   The alternatives of architectures with the appropriate views,

-   When necessary, a proposal to update / enrich refine the vision
    drivers and the architecture management plan.

During this phase the architect conducts most of the effort for
developing the architecture documents. The architecture must meet the
needs described in the vision; for instance procurement, realization,
evolution or definition. The architect defines the right granularity to
describe architecture elements. The delineation between “black box” and
“white box” allows limiting the development effort. A basic question is:
“do I need to open this black box for providing another black box
description[^16]? Which elements will be highlighted by this effort?”

The architecture team document[^17] architecture findings so as to
enable their validation by the stakeholders, and to ease decision making
at governance level. The validation of a model is completed by the
validation of the associated documentation.

The following diagram describes the views of the grid to be considered
for this stage.

# Evaluate Alternatives of Architectures and perform trade-off

During this phase the architect reviews the architecture against
principles, vision and other criteria (costs, legacies, capabilities and
other elements) in order to identify if a faster, a more effective or a
more efficient delivery of the system is possible.

The review of architecture provides an updated vision and a list of
trade-off grouped by Alternatives of Architectures.

The trade-off enables to check and assess the alternatives for
considering “what if” scenarios (what if the costs reduction are the key
factor? What if shorter delays are needed?). More important, this phase
enables to identify the technical questions and to secure the delivery
of the solution.

**Pre-requisite**

-   The criteria and the concerns for securing the delivery of
    architecture are delivered.

-   Alternatives of Architecture include confirmed key drivers,
    constraints, weights (priorities, criticality, etc.).

    -   The dimensions of the evaluation criteria are available (costs,
        effectiveness, politics, force structure, schedule, risks,
        flexibility, budget, TCO...)

    -   The weights and measurements of the values associated to each
        criterion are available.

-   Up-to-date vision and the architecture framework and principles are
    available

**Activities**

The architect lists the criteria for supporting the evaluation. The
architect:

-   Captures the concerns which can have an impact on the delivery of
    the project.

-   Produces the views, mostly matrices which support the evaluation of
    the architectures.

-   Prioritizes the criteria and weights each criterion in order to
    facilitate the assessment.

-   Determines/confirms the architecture evaluation grid.

-   Conducts the evaluation and the comparison w.r.t architecture goals
    and objectives.

-   Determines trade-offs that optimize (weighted) objectives.

-   Assesses trade-off architecture w.r.t key drivers and constraints.

The architect builds an assessment view of architecture alternatives,
highlighting the compliance of each to planning assumptions and
constraints. The architect builds an assessment matrix for identifying
the best trade-off (this assessment matrix is not included in the
portfolio of NAF views).The architect issues an assessment report on the
trade-off highlighting the selected trade-off.

**Outputs**

This stage enables the production of an Evaluation report with an
assessment grid including:

-   The score of (identified and assessed) alternatives of architecture
    against the selected criteria

-   The list of the trade-off and the precise definition of
    their contents...

-   The list of alternatives and their measurement against the trade-off
    (trade off criteria: TRL, effectiveness, efficiency, costs, delays…)

-   The selected trade off, stated and approved. It will be used as
    driver for the new baseline.

-   The list of views and the contexts to change in the future
    architecture baseline are clearly stated in the report.

-   The evaluation report is presented to the architecture board for
    decision on the trade-off.

The following diagram describes the views of the grid to be considered
for this stage.

# Plan Migration

This stage will enable the development of a migration plan based on the
aggregation of transition architectures[^18] which consolidate
implementation projects. The architect acts as a coordinator supporting
the sponsor in order to guarantee a feasible and manageable trajectory
achieves the realization of the solution[^19]. The outcomes of this
stage will allow governing the implementation/allocation according to
the roadmap.

The migration plan is an input for updating other documents like the
Project Management Plan (PMP) or the System Engineering Management Plan
(SEMP) of the “Yellow solution for SAR” through one or several
baselines. The architecture views describing the baselines can be issues
according two options:

-   Either the Architecture views related to the Migration Plan describe
    either a specific baseline (E.g. Pr (NSV-1))

-   Or the views describe Lines of development (trajectories/roadmaps)
    crossing baselines (E.g. NCV-3, NSV8, NSV-9, NTV2 \[NAF v4
    names here\]).

Baselines could be expressed with conceptual, logical or physical
approach (Capability provision, Service provision, asset
delivery/allocation).

**Pre-requisite**

-   The architecture development is completed.

-   The portfolio of AoA is available, trade-offs have been proposed and
    the agreed trade-off has been selected.

-   The list of concerns and options guiding the AoA are in the
    architecture repository,

-   The AoA evaluation report has been produced

-   The baseline of guiding documents are available

    -   Architecture contract.

    -   Architecture management plan.

    -   Vision.

    -   Architecture repository.

**Activities**

The architect receives the information on the implementation of the
solution. This information consists in legacies, deployment of
implementation projects or systems and future capabilities which need to
be blended for building the solution.

The architect aggregates the information in coherent chunks describing
the transition from one step to another, and aggregates transition
architectures in a coherent migration plan according to the selected
architecture roadmap. The architect ensures the changes applicable to
architecture are issued and managed.

The work packages and the roadmaps are presented to the sponsor and to
the stakeholders in order to ensure their buy-in

**Outputs**

-   Updated Architecture Definition

-   Preliminary WBS, PBS, Roadmaps and Implementation Plan for the
    impacted projects

-   Transition architectures

-   Migration Plan

-   Approved WBS including the list of work packages (provided at sub
    system level)

-   Approved Roadmaps

-   Architecture changes requests.

-   Approval of the migration plan by the sponsor.

# Govern Application of Architecture

The aim of this stage is to check that the migration plan is applied by
the projects and that the situations requiring changes are correctly
identified and notified towards the architecture board as a delta to the
architecture baseline (e.g. changes to views describing the baselines
including roadmaps/trajectories: P2 A5 and A6 at least, Cr, Pr, P1, A8).

Based on the evaluation report, the architect updates the architectures,
if required, in order to implement the migration plan. The objectives of
this phase aim at:

-   Ensuring the implementation projects impacted by the WBS and
    Roadmaps are aligned with the architecture including architecture
    products (interfaces, constituents, interactions and configurations)

-   Performing the functions for governing the implementation of the
    architecture

The approach for governing the application of architecture includes the
following activities:

-   Identify the connections between the WBS[^20] and Roadmap with their
    components, work packages, deliverables, products and milestones, in
    order to ensure the synchronization between:

    -   The architecture contents,

    -   The scheduling,

    -   The WBS, PBS[^21], Roadmaps and the list of CI[^22].

-   Check that the architecture management plan and the architecture
    contract support the adherence and includes the verification
    mechanisms between the implementation and the architecture.

**Pre-requisite**

-   The architecture is delivered,

-   The migration plan is delivered

-   An agreed WBS, PBS and Roadmap are available and shared,

-   All the deliverables of the preceding phases are stored in the
    architecture and in the project repositories.

The architect owns the architecture evaluation report (in the
architecture repository) describing:

-   Confirmed drivers and constraints

-   Confirmed architecture trade-off, hypotheses and rationale

-   Descriptions of alternatives of architecture: capability,
    operational, system, technical, phasing, and mapping views

-   Trade-off report

**Activities**

The architect conducts the following steps in order to govern the
architecture.

-   Confirm the scope and priorities,

-   Identify resources and skills needed,

-   Guide the development of the solutions according to the migration
    plan,

-   Perform compliance reviews,

-   Perform post-implementation reviews and close the implementation.

-   Review trade-off report and confirm consistency with drivers and
    constraints

**Outputs**

The following outputs will be delivered at the end of this phase.

-   (New version of) architecture contract and portfolio baseline

-   Updated architecture management plan

-   WBS, PBS, Roadmaps and Implementation Plan

-   Populated architecture repository

-   Change requests

-   Architecture vision (post-implementation)

# Decide on Architecture Change

Based on the precedent work aiming at defining a new baseline, the
architect assesses the work to be done on architecture and, if needed,
initiates a change request and presents it to the Architecture
Management Board, in order to engage another architecture development
cycle.

The following cases can trigger a change:

-   The capability is not effective enough, or it does not meet the
    operational requirements, or the objectives included in the vision.
    The description of the capability is not aligned with the
    architecture management plan.

-   Critical constraints (RAMS, budget and work-share) are not met.

-   The alignment of the new baseline is above the responsibility of the
    architecture team. Some skills, budget or planning adjustments
    are required.

The architect provides a basis for definition of a change including:

-   A description of the change.

-   The adjustments to the plan.

-   The adjustment to the architecture management plan.

-   The updated architecture contract

These documents are presented to the Architecture Management Board for
approval.

**Activities**

The architect:

-   Conducts a gap analysis

-   Formalizes the architecture changes requests

-   Presents the changes and obtains agreements within an architecture
    board meeting.

-   Baselines architecture change requests as agreed at Architecture
    Board Meeting.

**Outputs**

The architect provides the following documents:

-   A description of the change.

-   The adjustments to the plan and the assessments of the impacts
    to consider.

-   The adjustments to the architecture management plan.

-   The updated architecture contract.

The architecture management plan must capture the gap analysis
statement, the architecture decisions agreed in the architecture board
and they are stored in the Architecture Motivation Data definition
repository...

The following elements are stored in the repository

-   The gap analysis

-   The change request agreed with resources updated (Budget, timelines,
    new scope, skills...)

-   A new version of architecture baseline stored in the repository

-   Preliminary Architecture development Plan stored in the repository

-   Notification of changes published towards architecture Stakeholders

The nature of the change request impacts the views and architecture
products to be used.

Input Views

-   Any product of interest in the architecture repository.

Output Views

-   All Views and perspectives impacted by architecture change.

-   The nature of change may address capabilities, system or capability
    milestones, functions, services, organization, activities, etc.

Outputs are either

1.  Stop here.

2.  Iterate[^23] through an update of the Architecture vision and the
    following consequence of the vision update.

# Manage Architecture, Dashboards and Motivation data

The aim of this stage is to set and maintain architecture up-to-date
motivation data to feed the dashboard, monitor architecture progress
and stop/continue activities according to enterprise directives.
Motivation data translate project stakeholders’ expectations into
measurable objectives to allocate to architecting activities. Key
factors are considered to drive analyses and decisions.

This stage is executed after each stage of the architecture development
method. It allows cross-checking goals, objectives, requirements and
motivation along the execution of the project.

For the yellow country, the architect cross-checks after each stage
that:

1.  The capability lists, objectives and the capabilities covered by the
    SAR solution remains lined-up,

2.  Requirements on the SAR System remain consistent and SMART.

3.  The Requirements are well allocated.

This stage prevents the derivation of the project from architecture
objectives. It ensures that changes are recorded and their impact
assessed against requirements.

This stage bridges the stages related to architecture development and
the stages focusing on the delivery of the system.

The stage focuses on:

1.  Capabilities: for maintaining the architecture in line with the
    other aspects of the acquisition process.

2.  Requirements: For maintaining the specification and the description
    (both key elements of the acquisition) aligned.

3.  Constraints and metrics: For ensuring all information remains under
    control and included in the architecture development.

**Pre-requisite**

The architecture team builds a documentation baseline on the following
domains:

-   Capabilities: the capabilities are gathered in a coherent set of
    lists with specifications, roadmaps and definition documents. The
    stage “Set Architecture motivation data” ensures that a reliable
    list of capabilities is used for guiding the architecture
    development and that the elements of the architecture development,
    when needed, are integrated in the capabilities lists[^24].

-   Requirements: The requirements support the specification of the
    capabilities to be met by the system of the capability
    level architecture. Requirements bear the quantitative description
    of the system. Hence a strong link must be maintained between the
    architecture and the requirements.

-   Major inputs

    -   Yellow architecture landscape,

    -   Architecture KPIs

    -   Yellow SAR vision

    -   Elements of planning for delivering the Yellow solution (where
        to stop , when to issue the baselines)

    -   A baseline of requirements at appropriate level

**Activities**

The architect, after each phase:

-   Ensures that an agreement exists on the definition of the
    capabilities factors and their weights,

-   analyses top level requirements

-   checks the consistency of the existing capability lists and the
    requirements attached,

-   Maintains an effective and technically coherent management of the
    baselines of capabilities and requirements.

A consistent set of requirements and capability lists is maintained by
the architect and kept under configuration management.

**Outputs**

The architect ensures the following elements are kept updated:

-   List of selected/discarded/changed factors (or any of the
    motivation data)

    -   List of maintained/discarded top level requirements

    -   List of maintained /discarded objectives

    -   List of maintained/discarded milestones

The outputs are managed in consist in configuration management and
version control modules.

A requirement database is the key asset for managing motivation data and
dashboard.
