title: Scope
---

The NAF v4 methodology provides the strategy that outlines the way and
the environment in which architecture related activities are performed
and architectures are governed, managed, defined and evaluated. This
methodology has to be structured into applicable processes, methods and
means compliant with the organisation where the activities take place.

This methodology and the formalism described in Chapters 3 and 4 are to
be considered as a constructive generic framework.

The NAF v4 methodology does not intend to define precisely what
“Enterprise”, “Organisation” and “Project” terms are because the
literature provides a lot of meaning for them. However, in this document
the meaning is:

-   Enterprise is where the considered activities take place.

-   Organisation is how the enterprise is organised.

-   Project is the organisational structure of a considered activity.

The methodology addresses various stakeholders (Users, acquirers,
providers, builders, etc.) to either develop or use architectures.

Three main methodological areas are currently identified:

* The enterprise architecture area addresses how a group of people or
  organisations can work collaboratively on a portfolio of architectures
  with an enterprise vision. It provides explanation on the architecture
  landscape with workspace, libraries, and repositories in the enterprise.
  It also explains how activities can be performed with regards to the
  enterprise motivation and how activities can be used to govern the
  enterprise projects.

* The project architecture area covers the architectural environment,
  activities and artefacts in a project or a programme. A project is
  associated to any architecture within the enterprise.
  Note: This architecture can express the problem space and/or the
  solution space related to the entity being architected. In both cases,
  this architecture is defined to orient acquisition, development or
  exploitation program and projects.

* Foundation for architecting provides prerequisites and value factors to
  allow the viability of the architectures and their related activities at
  both the enterprise and the projects.
