title: Development of the Project architecture
---

The Yellow country based on the national Capability Level Architecture
and on the Rainbow documents on architecture develops a contract for the
acquisition of a system for Search and Rescue .A Project architecture
will be the cornerstone of the technical part of the contract.

The oroject architecture (PLA) :

1.  Describes the system to develop;

2.  Describes the interfaces with the existing and future systems;

3.  Describes the acquisition process[^25];

4.  Specifies the system elements of the system (CI[^26]);

5.  Describes the operational environment of the system and
    its capabilities.

The Project architecture is delivered as part of the contract. The
contractors will document this architecture and demonstrate the
compliance to the stakeholders’ needs, to the requirements and to design
constraints.

The architect and his team will execute the 8 stages of the NAF method
at project (Target) level

# Establish the architecture landscape

{%include rasterfigure.html url="image55.png" %}

This stage establishes the architecting capability according to
expectations and context, scope and target of the project. A set of
assumption are considered:

-   There is capability for architecting,

-   a repository of information exists.

The architect uses the architecting capability and draws the resources,
means and references of the scope for the development of the project
architecture.

The approach includes:

-   The identification of the references for issuing a statement of work
    for architecture,

-   Outline of architecture contract and architecture management plan.

The architecture management plan defines the following references
documents:

-   Context and constraints of the project, in particular, the links
    between the existing references and project architectures,

-   Capabilities, operational needs, acquisition process, limits,
    constraints, tools and standards,

-   Links between architecture and other disciplines like system
    engineering, requirements management, project management, etc.

-   Localisation and accesses to the architecture
    development repository.

-   Definition of skills, people and resources for conducting
    architecture activities.

**Prerequisites**

The following pre-requisites are met for engaging this stage:

-   Context, drivers and constraints are available

-   Business strategy, system/product/product-line strategy,
    Product/project portfolios are available

-   Capability Level Architecture scope and expectations are precisely
    fixed Architecture method and tools: Norms, Standards, know-how
    necessary to describe, to assess and to compare architecture
    alternatives are determined and available in the architecture team,

-   An Architecture repository (accessible to the architecture team as
    agreed with the support teams), to store and manage documented
    architecture is defined and implemented.

-   The Capability architecture related to the domains addressed by this
    architecture project exists at national and multinational levels.

**Activities**

From the Capability Level Architectures the architect checks he has all
elements for setting-up the architecture resources at project level and
that the appropriate information is available:

-   Architecture scope (Yellow Country), relationship with the
    architecture developed at Rainbow level related to the execution of
    the maritime surveillance?

-   Elements to be provided:

-   Links to the Catalogue of capabilities, definition of capabilities,

-   Time frame of the to be architecture, Budget: Elements of budget to
    be considered for the development of the reference architecture

-   Legacies: List of existing systems with date of obsolescence. The
    portfolios are used as inputs for providing this information
    (technological and products for existing projects).

The architect analyse architecture requirements within the contract in
order to define expected architecture products. Following questions are

-   Is the architecture work a deliverable of the contract?

-   Which parts of the architecture work are concerned? For instance, an
    operational concept document may be elaborated to orient
    architecture work, even if not specified in the list of
    main deliverable.

-   Which architecture views support architecture activities?

The Project architecture is here limited to the implementation of
functions of search and rescue, based on the functions identified in the
capability architecture of Yellow and Rainbow.

Stakeholders agree to the decisions made regarding :

-   The architecture tools,

-   The Method,

-   The links with other disciplines useful for the definition of the
    system (SE, Requirements Engineering),

-   The inputs and references of Rainbow community.

The architect defines the criteria for selecting the views, using
architecture principles. This activity aims at selecting the grid rows
and columns of relevance for meeting the architecture management plan
objectives.

The stakeholders define the criteria for assessing alternatives:

-   Operational criteria,

-   System criteria,

-   Standard criteria,

-   Costs.

The architect defines the content of the architecture statement of work,
of the architecture management plan and the structure of the
architecture repository (accessible for architecture team as agreed with
support teams) storing the documented architecture.

-   The architect identifies the architecture products to store in
    the repository.

-   The architect defines the complimentary information used for
    documenting the architecture products.

**Outputs**

The outputs consist in the **A1**[^27] **(Initial) with an outline of
the architecture management plan which supports the issue of a statement
of work.** The architecture management plan addresses the following
points:

-   Description of the architecture capability[^28] in terms of
    organization, processes, resources, tools and principles.

-   The process of architecting: description of the tailoring of the
    methodology and the need for selecting complementary
    architecture frameworks.

-   The architecture charter

    -   Methodology, Framework, References (Operational, system,
        technologies, services, capabilities).

    -   Resources: skills and roles in the architecting process (roles,
        job descriptions).

-   A project schedule identifying the main phases of the development.

-   Support tools (modelling and requirements): for defining, selecting,
    preparing and adapting the tools.

-   The management of the documentation and the configuration[^29] rules
    to be enforced in the project.

-   The principles and general rules and guidelines related to objective
    and drivers, selected from enterprise and/or architecture domains:

# Establish Architecture Vision


{%include rasterfigure.html url="image57.png" %}

During this phase the architect aggregates the elements of the
architecture in order to provide a detailed vision of the system to
deliver and he documents it in the architecture management plan. The
goal of the vision stage is to obtain the approval of the sponsor of the
project and his buy-in. The elements complementing the outline of the
architecture management plan will answer the following questions:

-   What are the scope and the content of the system?

-   Who does what for defining the system?

-   Where is the work executed?

-   When the work is executed (schedule)?

-   How the job is executed (WBS, OBS, Structure, Management)?

-   What is the trajectory considered for building the system?

-   Why is this job executed?

-   What is the end state to achieve when the system is delivered?

The elements related to decisions, authority, results and acceptance of
the architecture are included as high level descriptions of the system
in a communication plan.

**Objective**

The stage “Establish architecture vision” provides a context for
describing the system to deliver in terms of capabilities, operational
activities, system functions, system elements, data, interactions and
other aspects[^30] related to the implementation. It includes these
descriptions in the project architecture. This stage confirms that the
statement of work and the outline of the architecture management plan
are complete, well understood and supported by the stakeholders.

The following key drivers direct the execution of the stage Architecture
Vision.

-   Provide a solution for search and rescue,

-   Deliver a solution compliant with standard rules,

-   Conduct Monitoring surveillance and information sharing for
    supporting search and rescue.

-   Address airborne and maritime search and rescue teams.

The following options support the definition of the purpose of the
architecture effort:

-   Deliver a solution compliant with the performance and design
    requirements of search and rescue systems as defined in the
    Capability Level Architecture,

-   Provide a solution re-using the legacies and increasing the
    coordination of search and rescue activities in the Yellow country
    and between the nations,

-   Provide a roadmap for contracting synchronizing the
    “delivery time”(milestone) of the capability with the Yellow country
    milestones (from the CLA[^31]),

-   Provide the information for the acquisition.

The architect defines the key drivers for example:

-   Operational drivers:

    -   Increase effectiveness of the systems of search and rescue,

    -   Optimize the liaison with the civilian actors

    -   Optimize the liaison with the security actors,

-   Baseline for interoperability :

    -   Maximizing the use of AIS

    -   Optimize the Interoperability with air traffic

    -   Optimize the Interoperability with Emergency actors

The architect builds a consolidated report describing the vision, work
share, deliverables. The elements of the architecture descriptions are
grouped in a communication plan.

**Prerequisite**

The repository and the architecture landscape is in place, the CLA are
included in the architecture repository, the resources are sufficient,
for conducting the stage.

The Architecture board is nominated (officially) and has agreed on the
architecture management plan work within available budget.

**Steps**

-   Confirm/Update stakes, context, constraints,

-   The architect checks the objectives of the architecture contract.

-   The architect checks the capabilities, operational functions,
    drivers, objectives and key level information needed for developing
    the PLA[^32].

-   The architect confirms the list of stakeholders and the information
    they can provide.

-   The architect provides the appropriate answers, if the change
    implies the redefinition of the system or of one of its parts,
    (change of manning, change of resources, new areas or
    interoperability challenges to consider).

-   The architect confirms the tailoring of the views and of the
    architecture products or of the process (process for architecting.)

-   The architect selects the portfolio of views based on the grid...

-   The architect defines the timelines for delivering the
    architecture products.

-   The architect identifies the work streams to execute for delivering
    the portfolio.

-   The architect identifies the different steps of the development, the
    portfolio to be produced and the mapping with existing references
    (capabilities, operational functions, organizations; services;
    legacies and pre-existing building blocks).

**Outputs**

This stage enables the delivery and the approval of the following
documents:

1.  An architecture definition document or ideally an architecture
    management plan,

2.  A first iteration of the A5 establishing the foundation and the
    scope for the architecture development,

3.  A synthetic narrative of the vision

The architect develops an architecture management plan including at
minimum the following elements

-   High-level scope for the architecture, using text-based
    capability goals.

-   High level description (or views…) of the capability context
    ((business, industrial, political, operational, legal).

-   Documents to be officially approved and accepted by the sponsor or
    by the customer.

-   High level description of project level strategic objectives and
    goals as understood by the architecture team; and taking into
    account the viewpoints of key stakeholders.

-   Approach considered for architecture development.

-   Communication plan.

# Describe Alternatives Architectures


{%include rasterfigure.html url="image63.png" %}

This stage is the more concrete activity in the development of the
architecture. It embraces the production of the architecture products
(views and documents) describing the “to be “system. This stage ensures
that the description is fully aligned with the vision and includes the
different options of the implementation. The alternatives of
architectures (AOA) consist in a limited architecture work –usually a
scenario- answering a typical stakeholder’s concern.

The architecture development is complete at the end of this stage. The
views are included in an architecture report.

**Pre-requisite**

The following pre-requisites are met for engaging this stage.

-   The vision has been published and is agreed by the sponsor.

-   The architecture management plan is published and agreed. The
    resources for developing the architecture are funded, manned
    and equipped.

-   An architecture baseline is accessible to the stakeholders (in a
    repository consolidating artefacts and describing the
    appropriate references)

-   All the documents needed for developing the architecture are grouped
    for the architecture team including documents and models on the
    legacies system.

-   The CLA[^33] for developing the PLA[^34] are shared. The architect
    has a list of views to be developed for each domain (communication,
    IT, information, and operational activities), each type ( Business ,
    Information, Application and Technology architectures). The method
    and mechanisms for producing the documentation are in place. The
    templates and the information to be included in the documents are
    available and tested.

-   Drivers for identifying the possible AoA are available.

**Activities**

The architect, based on the available documents, develops the views
describing the system. The architect aligns the design of the solution
to a to down description of the capabilities and operational views. The
architect identifies the options or alternatives to the top down
description and documents them in specific views. The architect uses a
tree structure[^35] for detailing the operational functions,
capabilities, services, system functions, system elements and other
information elements to be captured in the architecture work. The grid
links the views, the information elements and the concerns. For the
project architecture, the architect focuses on concerns related to
implementation and to links with the existing capabilities and
processes; the architecture is more concrete, easy to check and traced
back to requirements. The following cycles can be considered for
developing the architecture

1.  Confirm/ update architecture drivers (qualitative assessment)

2.  Identify possible AoA,

3.  Confirm/ update list of artefacts (views, rationale, etc.),

4.  Confirm / update the list of views (based on the grid),

5.  Develop architecture views including the mapping between views
    and resources. (“As is” and “To be”)

The architecture team produces the views according to the specific
perspectives and viewpoints selected in the grid. It will bear in mind
the need to limit the develop effort to the “good enough” solution in
order to avoid over-specifications. The architect, for the Project
architecture, limits his work to the “system only” perspective and
avoids pushing the description to a sub-system element level.

The views are produced by the following artefacts:

1.  Tables, lists

2.  Narratives

3.  Diagrams

4.  Matrices,

The architect beaks-down the subject of architecture efforts in main
elements according to specific perspectives or concerns. The
identification of the following aspects is key for producing a reliable
architecture:

1.  The objects to be described,

2.  The domains,

3.  The relations between objects at the same levels,

4.  The information exchanged.

Key point: each object of the architecture must be correctly and
completely documented with an explicit and unambiguous information and
reference link[^36].

**Outputs**

During this phase the architect team provides the following documents
and artefacts.

1.  An updated version of the architecture model with the
    appropriate views.

2.  A list of alternatives and their description ,

3.  The documents for supporting the realization of the system and
    its delivery.

According to the architecture management plan, the following elements
could be provided:

-   A Draft architecture report capturing the portfolio as tailored in
    the vision and the preceding phases.

-   The scenarios related to the alternatives of architectures with the
    appropriate views,

-   The vision drivers and the architecture management plan which have
    been updated, if necessary.

During this phase the architect conducts most of the effort for
developing the architecture documents.

The architect must bear in mind the importance of the granularity to
consider for describing the elements of the architecture. The
delineation between the description in “black box” and “white box” must
be the driver for limiting the development effort. A basic question
could be “do I need to open this black box for providing another black
box description? What is highlighted by this specific architecture
decomposition?”

The architect gives a great care to the documents to be validated by the
stakeholders. The validation of a model is very difficult and can be
completed, only through the validation of the documentation which is
generated by the modelling tool.

# Evaluate Alternatives of Architecture and propose a trade-off

{%include rasterfigure.html url="image69.png" %}

During this stage, the architect assesses the options for reducing
costs, de-risking the acquisition, ensuring the adequate solution is
delivered and an easy acceptance of the system. He evaluates the
compliance level of the architecture with the stakeholders and system
requirements.

The architecture is usually developed with a main track and
alternatives, the architect identifies the “what if” scenarios
supported by the alternatives and the related trade-off.

The review of architecture provides an updated vision and a series of
trade-off grouped by Alternatives of Architectures. The criteria used
for identifying the AoA are confirmed key drivers , constraints and
confirmed weights (priorities, criticality, etc.)are the.

The trade-off enables to check and assess the alternatives against
criteria in order to consider “what if” scenarios (what if the costs
reduction are the key factor? What if shorter delays are needed?).
More important, this phase enables to identify the key technical
questions and to secure the delivery of the solutions.

**Pre-requisite**

-   The key criteria for securing the delivery of the architecture
    are delivered. The concerns influencing the project have been
    identified by the stakeholders. Architecture alternatives are
    described, with key drivers and constraints including confirmed
    weights (priorities, criticality, etc.)

-   The dimensions of the evaluation criteria are available (costs,
    effectiveness, politics, force structure, schedule, risks,
    flexibility, budget, TCO[^37]...)

-   The weights and measurements of the values associated to each
    criterion are available.

-   If need be an Up to date shared vision and the architecture
    framework and principles are available.

**Activities**

The architect builds a list of criteria and weights them. Some
examples of criterion are

* Costs reduction;

* Assessment of the level of resources needed for developing each
  component;

* Assessment of the parts which can be outsourced and the one
  requiring sole source acquisition;

* Insurance of meeting the requirements and the expected capabilities;

* Identification of options for better meeting the requirements;

* Identification of the dependencies against some of the capabilities
  components;

* Insurance that the timelines will be met;

* Make or buy decisions;

* Technical options;

* An evaluation grid captures the evaluation and the options
  considered;

A report describes the options selected for developing AoA.

The architect:

-   groups the AoA according to the planning options and builds only the
    views related to AoA.

-   builds an assessment matrix for each trade-off.

-   issues an assessment report on the trade-off highlighting the
    selected trade-off leading to some options on the delivery of
    the solution.

**Outputs**

The architect issues an evaluation report describing the main options
for mitigating the risks in the PLA and in the system. This report
includes the score of (identified and assessed) alternatives of
architecture, the list of the trade-off and the precise definition of
its contents, the list of alternatives and their measurement against a
trade-off off (trade off criteria: TRL, effectiveness, efficiency,
costs, delays…).

Each selected trade-off is clearly stated when approved. It will be
used as driver for development of the AoA. The list of views and the
contexts to change in the future architecture developments are clearly
statedin the report. The evaluation report is presented to the
architecture board for decision on the trade-off.

# Plan Migration

This stage will enable the development of a migration plan based on the
aggregation of transition architectures[^38] which consolidate
implementation projects. The architect acts as a coordinator supporting
the sponsor in order to guarantee a feasible and manageable trajectory
achieves the realization of the solution[^39]. The outcomes of this
stage will allow governing the implementation/allocation according to
the roadmap.

The migration plan is an input for updating other documents like the
Project Management Plan (PMP) or the System Engineering Management Plan
( SEMP)of the “solution” through one or several baselines.

The architecture views describing the baselines can be issues according
two options:

-   Either the Architecture views related to the Migration Plan describe
    either a specific baseline (E.g. Pr (NSV-1))

-   Or the views describe Lines of development (trajectories/roadmaps)
    crossing baselines (E.g. NCV-3, NSV8, NSV-9, NTV2 \[NAF v4
    names here\]).

This stage enables the delivery of work packages, roadmaps and a work
breakdown structure for a coherent realization of the system. The
architect assesses the WBS[^40], a list of CI, a Schedule of delivery or
a roadmap for delivering the system. The Work packages can consist in
the following elements:

1. Infrastructure

2. Core services

3. Service management and control

4. Information Assurance

5. User services

6. Operational services

The architect coordinates the work packages supporting the architecture.

The Project architecture provides the list of work packages and the
roadmap.

**Pre-requisite**

* The architecture development is completed,

* The portfolio of AoA is available,

* The list of concerns and options guiding the AoA are in the
  Architecture repository,

* The AoA evaluation report has been produced

* The baseline of guiding documents is available

* Architecture contract,

* Architecture management plan,

* Vision,

* Architecture repository.

**Activities**

The architect assesses the list of configuration items included in the
system elements. They have been grouped in coherent packages and
allocated to providers for supporting the integration, by the work
packages owners.

The work packages are allocated to sub-system level providers. The work
packages and the roadmaps are presented to the sponsor and to the
stakeholders in order to ensure their buy-in.

Iteratively, the stakeholders synchronize the roadmaps and the WBS. The
agreed and synchronized WBS/Roadmaps packages are presented to the
sponsor for official approval.

**Outputs**

-   Approved WBS including the list of work packages

# Govern Application of Architecture

{%include rasterfigure.html url="image72.png" %}

During this phase, the architect updates the architectures according to
the evaluation report (ref. Establish Alternatives architectures and get
trade-off). The objectives of this stage are:

-   Ensuring that the implementation projects impacted by the WBS and
    the Roadmaps are aligned with the architecture,

-   Performing the functions for governing the implementation of the
    architecture in the system.

The approach for governing the application of architecture includes
identifying the connections between the WBS and the Roadmap, in order to
ensure the synchronization between:

-   The architecture contents,

-   The scheduling,

-   The WBS, PBS[^41], Roadmaps and the list of CI[^42].

The architect checks that the architecture management plan, the project
architecture and the architecture contract support the implementation of
the system. The architects confirms that each sub-system identified is
associated to a WBS, a PBS, roadmap and costs for ensuring that each
sub-system element can be achieved.

**Pre-requisite**

-   The architecture is delivered,

-   WBS[^43], PBS and Roadmaps are available and shared.

-   The architecture evaluation report has been approved.

<!-- -->

-   The Trade-off report has been delivered and approved.

**Activities**

The architect:

-   Conducts the following steps in order to govern the architecture.

-   Confirms the scope and the priorities.

-   Identifies the resources and the skills needed for implementing
    the system.

-   Supports compliance reviews.

-   Supports post-implementation reviews which close the implementation.

-   Reviews trade-off report and confirms its consistency with the
    drivers and the constraints.

**Outputs**

The following outputs are delivered at the end of this phase.

-   An updated architecture contract

-   WBS, PBS, Roadmaps and Implementation Plan

-   A Populated architecture repository

-   The list of change requests

-   The Architecture vision post-implementation

-   A Migration Plan

# Decide on architecture change

{%include rasterfigure.html url="image74.png" %}

The list of changes is gathered and the architecture management board
assesses the changes to be done and it engages the management
procedures.

The following cases can trigger a change:

-   The performances are not met, the interfaces need further
    development, the tests planned are not conclusive and need to be
    refined and complemented.

-   Critical constraints (RAMS, budget, and work share) are not met.

-   The alignment of the new baseline is above the responsibility of the
    architecture team. Some skills, budget or planning adjustments
    are required.

The architect provides a basis for definition of a change including:

-   A description of the change,

-   The adjustments to the plan,

-   The adjustment to the architecture management plan,

-   The updated architecture contract.

**Activities**

The architect performs the following tasks

-   Gap analysis,

-   Formalization of architecture changes requests,

-   Presentation of the changes and obtain agreements within an
    architecture board meeting,.

-   Baseline architecture change requests as agreed at Architecture
    Board Meeting.

**Outputs**

The architect provides the following documents:

-   A description of the change including the adjustments to the roadmap
    and to the architecture management plan.

-   The updated architecture contract

The AMP is updated for capturing the gap analysis statement. The
architecture decisions agreed in the architecture board are stored in
the Architecture Motivation Data definition repository.

The following elements are stored in the repository:

-   The change request agreed with resources updated (Budget, timelines,
    new scope, skills...)

-   Preliminary Architecture development Plan stored in the repository

-   Notification of changes published towards architecture Stakeholders

# Manage Architecture, Dashboards and Motivation Data

{%include rasterfigure.html url="image76.png" %}

The aim of this stage is to set and maintain architecture up-to-date
motivation data to feed the dashboard, monitor architecture progress and
stop/continue activities according to enterprise directives. Motivation
data translate project stakeholders’ expectations into measurable
objectives to allocate to architecting activities. Key factors are
considered to drive analyses and decisions.

This stage is executed after each stage of the NADM. It authorizes to
cross-check that goals, objectives, requirements and motivation data
remain aligned with the execution of the project.

This stage is repeated between phases of the architecture development.
The architect will use the following techniques for consolidating the
delivery of the Project architecture :

1.  ***Requirement engineering:***

    The architect will synch-up with the requirements engineering team
    in order to build a coherent baseline of requirements, to allocate
    the requirements with the architecture elements in order to provide
    a coherent description and a specification of the system. The
    contractual requirements are linked with the Project architecture .

2.  ***Project Management:***

    The decomposition of the project is presented with consistent
    roadmaps and plans. This activity is conducted with the support of
    the architecture team for producing the requirements and
    traceability’s related to WBS, PBS and schedules. They are
    elaborated and updated in each phase of the project.

3.  ***Risk Management:***

    A risk register is maintained and linked to the changes and to
    the architectures. Achieving this guarantees the delivery of the
    contract or of the system. The risk register is kept and maintained
    in the architecture repository.

4.  ***Capabilities development:***

    A traceability matrix is maintained in order to ensure that the
    system supports a specific set of capabilities even when
    they change.

**Pre-requisite**

The architecture team builds a documentation baseline on the following
domains:

-   **Capabilities:** The capabilities are gathered in a coherent set of
    lists with specifications, roadmaps and definition documents. The
    phase “Set Architecture motivation data” ensures that a reliable
    list of capabilities is used for guiding the architecture
    development and that the elements of the architecture development,
    when needed, are integrated in the capabilities lists[^44].

-   **Requirements:** The requirements support the specification of the
    capabilities to be met by the subject of the RA. Hence a tight link
    must be maintained between the architecture and the requirements.

**Activities**

The architect, after each phase:

-   Updates the requirement databases, the risk register, the plans
    and roadmaps.

-   Updates the list of the capabilities, checks the consistency of the
    existing capability lists against the requirements attached,

-   Maintains an effective and technically coherent management of the
    baselines of capabilities and requirements.

The architect maintains a consistent set of requirements and capability
lists. He ensures the motivation data are managed under configuration
management.

**Outputs**

The architect ensures the following elements are up to date:

-   List of selected/discarded/changed factors (or any of the
    motivation data)

    -   Database of requirements with Validation Cross Reference Index

    -   Database of capabilities with definitions and links to
        operational functions and activities.

    -   Plans and roadmaps for implementation

    -   Risk register.

All these deliverables are stored in the architecture repository under
configuration management.
