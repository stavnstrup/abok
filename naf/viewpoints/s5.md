title: S5 – Service States
legacy: "NAF v3: NSOV-4b; MODAF: SOV-4b"
---

The S5 Service States View specifies the possible states a service may have, and
the possible transitions between those states.

## Concerns Addressed

* Detailed Service Specifications.
* Outline requirements for Service behaviour.
* Service implementation guidance.

## Background

It is generally considered good practice to make services stateless – i.e. consumers
of a service are not aware of what state the service is in. However, in specifying a
service, it is often necessary to specify the allowable states so as to constrain how
implementations of the service will behave. The S5 View is a specification of those
states, and the possible transitions between them.

## Usage

* Service behaviour specification.

## Representation

* UML.
* Other state transition models.

## Detailed View Description

S5 views are usually UML (or similar) state transition models.

An S5 view may also specify performance constraints (e.g. the maximum duration a
service may be in a particular state):
