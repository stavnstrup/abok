title: Description of the actors of the scenario
---

This part describes the major stakeholders of the Rainbow Organisation
and of the nations involved in the realization of the SAR capability.

# Multinational level
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rainbow organisation embraces various committees synchronizing
program development activities. Programs are coordinated at
multinational level, even if they have been acquired, directed and
operated by the member nations.

The Rainbow organisation:

1.  Directs multinational projects,

2.  Defines multinational rules and standards,

3.  Recommends national standards and interoperability rules,

4.  Establishes a governance model at multinational level on security
    capabilities and systems

The Rainbow organisation consists in the following committees:

1. **Rainbow Safety and Security Committee (RSSC):***
   The RSSC includes representatives from the Rainbow nations; it
   develops the rules, plans, list of capabilities and roadmaps for
   safety and security across the area under the Rainbow organisation
   authority. The RSSC has developed a strategic vision, goals and
   objectives, a capability roadmap and policies.

2. **Rainbow Acquisition Committee:**

   The Rainbow acquisition committee defines the systems to be procured
   by the Rainbow organisation. It also provides guidance to the nations
   for ensuring consistent development of national systems in terms in
   procurement and interoperability. This committee includes the Rainbow
   architecture team who describe the capabilities and systems related to
   security through architectures.

   The architects deliver rules related to design and interoperability
   through architecture products. Architectures are a part of the
   procurement baseline of documents.

   The Rainbow organisation has set-up a specific operational centre (the
   ROCS), for coordinating security activities on the Rainbow Territory:

   -   It gathers national information shared by the countries;

   -   It provides a consolidated operational picture;

   -   It coordinates the intervention teams -provided and commanded by the
       member nations- for assisting, controlling and monitoring the
       Rainbow territory, seas and airspace.

3. **The Capability Planning Group:**

   The Rainbow Capability Planning Group (RCPG) guarantees that the
   Rainbow organization owns the appropriate capability in order to
   fulfil its missions. The RCPG operates as a coordinator between the
   nations and with the acquisition, users and RSCC. The RCPG owns the
   capability roadmaps of the Rainbow Organization and has access to
   those of the Rainbow countries.

4. **The Users’ Committee:**

   This committee groups representatives from the multinational and
   national users, operating and defining the systems. The ROSC “Rainbow
   Operational Security Centre”:

   They provide feedback on the system and on their design. They belong
   to the following communities of interest:

   1.  Navy;

   2. Coast Guard;

   3. Border Guards;

   4. Air Force:

   5.  Customs;

   6. Operational centres.

# National level : The Yellow country

Each country is responsible for acquiring, implementing and operating
the security systems. Each country owns a surveillance system consisting
of operational centres, surveillance sites and a communication network.

Each country conducts:

-   National regulations for security systems;

-   Design and implementation standards guidance;

-   Acquisition processes.

In the Yellow country the following communities of actors have been
identified: users and operators. They conduct security and
intervention missions. The users and operators communities include:

-   The Navy: conducting surveillance and interventions in the maritime
    environment outside of Yellow territorial Waters (TW) (mostly in the
    Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)

-   The coasts guards

-   The Air Force

-   Customs

-   Medical services
