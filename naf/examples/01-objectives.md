title: Objectives of the examples
---

This section details the implementation of the NAF v4 methodology for
developing architectures. Chapter 2, Methodology describes the necessary
tasks for producing a NAF compliant architecture. This document provides
an example illustrating the steps, techniques, deliverables and tools
used for supporting the NAF methodology through the entire lifecycle of
capabilities.

It illustrates:

1.  The method to follow for producing the Capability Level Architecture
    and the integration of the sub-systems of a system
    procured nationally. It is the search and rescue (SAR) system of the
    Yellow country

2.  The usage of some tools and techniques-like the grid, for selecting
    the views according to the viewpoints and for developing the
    architecture management plan.

3.  The application of the method to a non-military domain for extending
    the range of the NATO Architecture Framework (NAF).

The structure of this annex is as follows:

1.  Section 1: Objectives of the examples, this chapter.

2.  Section 2: Overall use case description detailing the environment of
    the use case, including the elements of the enterprise architecture
    of the multinational organisation.

3.  Section 3: Description of the actors of the scenario, including
    national and multinational actors.

4.  Section 4: Development of the capability architecture describing the
    method for providing a capability architecture in national
    environment

5.  Section 5: Development of the project architecture describing the
    method for supporting the acquisition of a search and rescue system
    by a nation.

6.  Appendix 1: Detailing an Architecture Management Plan.

This example integrates the recent developments on NATO Enterprise
architecture Policies.

The working paper AC/322-WP (2015)0011-REV3 introduces a new
classification of the NATO Enterprise architectures based on levels and
types. This section details the classification used in the following
part of the document. As much as possible the link between this new
denomination and the precedent one will be made. The EA efforts
conducted in the different bodies of NATO can be sorted according to
**levels**:

1.  **Enterprise architecture at Level: **

    “They provide the architecture content that forms the foundation for
    architectural coherence across the entire NATO Enterprise, and beyond.
    Architectures at this level will span many change programmes (e.g.
    capability packages). These architectures were previously known as
    “Overarching Architecture”.

2.  **Architecture at Capability Level:**

    “Architectures at this level are used to support the delivery of
    large, multi-phased and multi-project change initiatives (e.g.
    capability packages).” These architectures were previously known as
    “Reference Architecture”.

3.  **Architecture at Project Level:**

    “Architectures at this level are describing the envisioned solution
    that the project aims to implement.” These architectures were
    previously known as “Project architecture”.

Architectures on each level cover the following types:

1.  **Business Architecture:**

    It describes the business strategy, governance, organization, and key
    business processes (including process ownership and key decisions) of
    the organization.

2.  **Information Architecture:**

    It describes the structure of an organization's logical and physical
    information assets and the associated data management resources
    linking the information required to the key business processes and
    decisions.

3.  **Application Architecture:**

    It provides a blueprint for the individual application systems to be
    deployed, the information which they provide, the interactions between
    the application systems and their relationships to the core business
    processes of the organization with the frameworks for services to be
    exposed as business functions for integration.

4.  **Technology Architecture:**

    It describes the hardware, software and network infrastructure needed
    to support the deployment of the application systems.

The notion of “types” is an additional layer organizing the views
according to a specific concern, Business, Information, Application and
Technology. Each type of architecture can include 2 perspectives
according to the timeline considered:

1.  The “As is” perspective consisting in a description of the system in
    its current status, this perspective is named “Baseline” in TOGAF.

2.  The ‘To be” Perspective: consisting in a description of the system
    in its future status when the end-state is reached, this perspective
    is named “Target” in TOGAF.

3.  The following diagram describes the organization of the “NATO
    Enterprise architecture Policy” document.

4.  The following diagram summarizes the recommendations of the NATO
    EA Policy.
