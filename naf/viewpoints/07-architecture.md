title: Architecture Metadata Layer
viewpoint: architecture

The Architecture Meta-Data layer covers the administrative aspects of the
architecture, such as who created it, for whom and when. Each architecture view is
itemised and may be traced back to individual stakeholder concerns. Versions of
architecture descriptions may be tracked and the planning (architecture roadmap)
can also be captured in the Architecture Meta-Data layer.
