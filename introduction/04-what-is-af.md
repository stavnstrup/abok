title: What is an Architecture Framework?
---

An architecture framework is a specification of how to organize and present an enterprise through architecture descriptions. ISO/IEC 42010 describes an Architecture Framework as:

“The *conventions, principles and practices for the description of architectures established within a specific domain of application and/or community of stakeholders*”.

It consists of a set of standard viewpoints which ISO/IEC 42010 describes as:

“The *work product establishing the conventions for the construction, interpretation and use of architecture views to frame specific system concerns*”.

To manage complexity for NATO, an Architecture Framework has been developed and defines a standard set of viewpoints which each have a specific purpose. NAF define viewpoints in terms of the concerns they address.
