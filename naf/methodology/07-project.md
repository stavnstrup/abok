title: Architecting in a project

# Overview of Project architecting activities

Project architecture defines the rationale for architecture moving from
the “As-is” to a “To-be” architecture. Starting from the overall
context, and applying enterprise directives and policies, the project
vision is set according to the concerns of stakeholders and associated
priorities. The latter are used to initialise key architecture
requirements as part of the motivation data. During architecting
activities, the motivation data is enriched consistently with the
rationale associated to identified architecture alternatives, evaluation
criteria and trade-offs when necessary.

Evaluation criteria are initialised from vision elements, namely
architecture objectives.

The description stage identifies and describes alternatives of
architectures which satisfy key architecture requirements and known
constraints.

The evaluation stage provides support to decision-making, using criteria
agreed by stakeholders.
