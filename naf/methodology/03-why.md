title: Why do we need this architecting methodology?
---

Based on existing methods and proven experience on architecting through
various business domains, this methodology provides a constructive
generic framework to ensure efficient architecting. The methods
described or referenced in the methodology define the usable and
adaptable concepts, means, proceeding and outcomes.

This methodology provides a strategic base to set-up architecting
activities within an organisation with necessary and justified tailoring
to fit with particular architecting context.

The motivation is providing a baseline of formalised processes and
assets descriptions in order to:

* Have unique and homogeneous architecture repository and architecting
  environment

* Ease governance and management

* Allow collaborative architecting activities
