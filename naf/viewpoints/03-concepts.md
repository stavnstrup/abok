title: Concepts Layer
---

The Concepts layer supports the process of analysing and optimizing the delivery
of capabilities in line with the enterprise-s strategic intent.  It achieves
this by capturing the enterprise-s strategic vision and concepts and
capabilities.  These capabilities can be organised into a taxonomy and then
augmented with schedule data and measures of effectiveness to enable the
analysis of capability gaps and overlaps.  The Concepts layer further details
the dependencies between capabilities, enabling capability options to be built
in a more coherent manner and effective trade-offs to be conducted (e.g. across
NATO common funded programmes).
