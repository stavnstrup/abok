title: Logical Specifications Layer
viewpoint: logical

The Logical Specifications layer is a solution-independent description of the
logical nodes (elements of capability), activities, and resource/information
exchanges required to accomplish missions. Those missions include both
war-fighting missions and business processes. The Logical views specify
graphical and textual views that identify the logical nodes, their behaviour and
interactions. The Logical Specifications layer specifies the logical information
exchanges (and exchanges of resources), the frequency of exchange and which
activities produce and consume the exchanges. The Logical Specifications layer
can also be used to specify required service levels and how services are
orchestrated to support the mission.
