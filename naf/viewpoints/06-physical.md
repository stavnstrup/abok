viewpoint: physical

The Physical Resource Specifications Layer is a set of graphical and textual views
that describe the structure, connectivity and behaviour of the various types of
Resource that make up the physical architecture. Resource Types include people,
organisations, artefacts, software and configurations of any or all of them. In
particular, these views are used to specify how Types of Resources are configured
and connected to deliver Capabilities and Services. The Physical Resource
Specifications Layer is used to support functions in both war-fighting and business. It
links Resources back to the logical nodes specified in the Logical Specifications layer
to provide requirements traceability. Resource Functions are also traced back to
Activities in the Logical Specifications layer.
