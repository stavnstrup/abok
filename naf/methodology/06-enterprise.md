title: Architecting for the enterprise scope
---


Architecture elaborated to master the overall enterprise business are
typically:

-   Architecture of the enterprise itself. The enterprise is therefore
    analysed with a systemic approach from the enterprise internal and
    external stakeholdersâ€™ viewpoints. This allows formalising the
    enterprise processes, roles, information system(s), assets, etc.

-   Architectures used by the programmes and the projects of the
    enterprise in order to deliver the enterprise systems/products
    required by internal and external contracts.

In both cases these architectures provide directions and guidance for
the enterprise programmes and projects in charge of developing and
maintaining either the enterprise itself or the enterprise
systems/products.

These architectures have to be considered as an input for enterprise
governance.
