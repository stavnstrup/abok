The A6 Architecture Versions View shows the version history of the architecture with
relevant meta-data.

## Concerns Addressed

* Architecture Management.
* Configuration Control of Architectures.

## Background

Where the A5 View shows the current version number and approval status for the
architecture, the A6 View shows the complete history of the architecture.

## Usage

* Recovery of old architecture models.
* Version management.

## Representation

The A6 View is usually shown as a simple timeline depicting the periods of time
during which each architecture version was considered current – i.e. the period from
release to withdrawal.

## Detailed View Description

The A6 View expands on the information in the A5 by showing the catalogue of
previous architecture versions. For each version, it is also possible to show relevant
meta-data:

Each version should at least show which framework was used so that appropriate
tooling can be found for viewing working on legacy architectures.
